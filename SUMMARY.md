# Test Report - [Hostfully QA Test]

## Task Overview

The assigned task involved testing and validating various functionalities of the Computers Database website. These functionalities included adding a new computer, deleting an existing computer, editing the details of a registered computer, and testing filters and sorting options. The general approach taken was to systematically test each functionality to ensure that they operate as expected and to validate the overall performance and user experience of the website.

## Findings

### Finding 1: [Read Only Aplication]

The initial observation was that the application appeared to be read-only, meaning that functionalities such as editing and creating could not be fully tested. To address this limitation, I performed checks using the success and error messages generated by the application. By analyzing these messages, I aimed to simulate and assess the outcomes of edit and create operations, even though direct testing of these functionalities within the application was constrained. This approach allowed for a partial evaluation of the intended functionalities and helped gather insights into the behavior of the application in scenarios where direct testing was not feasible.

### Finding 2: [Edge Cases]

The second finding involved the validation of edge cases, necessitating an understanding of the normal behavior of the application. For instance, when adding a new computer, I observed that the "Name" field accepted special characters and numbers, whereas the "Introduced" and "Discontinued" fields only accepted the date format (yyyy-mm-dd). This understanding of the typical application behavior allowed for the validation of error handling for these functionalities. By intentionally providing inputs that deviated from the expected norm, such as attempting to input invalid characters in the "Name" field or entering dates in an incorrect format, I could assess how well the application handled and responded to such edge cases. This type of testing helps ensure the robustness and reliability of the application under various scenarios.


## Issues

### Issue 1: [Delete this computer button covered]

To overcome this issue and proceed with the tests, I had to use the click({ force: true }) property in Cypress. This property allows for a forced click on an element, bypassing any obstruction or overlay. In this case, the "Delete This Computer" button being partially covered by the H1 header ("Edit Computer") posed a visual obstruction, and the force: true option was essential to ensure that the click action was executed despite the overlapping elements. This approach enabled the continuation of the testing process by addressing the specific challenge posed by the UI layout.

### Issue 2: [Order by date without numbers]

When clicking to sort date fields where the date is not registered, it displays "-". To continue verifying whether it is in ascending or descending order, I utilized a conditional structure to check the content of the field before assessing the order.


## Decisions Made

Dynamic Data Handling:

The code dynamically retrieves computer data from fixtures based on the provided fixture name for both good and bad computer information.

Conditional Check for Fixture Existence:

There's a conditional check to ensure that the specified fixture name exists. If not, an error is thrown.

Handling Empty Data Scenario:

When checking the computer names order, the code checks if all dates are "-" and logs a message, terminating the test if true.

Forcing Click with { force: true }:

To handle an issue where an element is partially covered, the code uses click({ force: true }) to force the click on the "Delete This Computer" button.

Using invoke('val') for Input Value Retrieval:

When editing a computer, the code uses invoke('val') to retrieve the current value of an input field and then manipulates it.

Checking and Asserting Error Messages:

The code checks for the existence of specific error messages and asserts their presence.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this testing experience proved to be highly valuable as it allowed me to showcase my proficiency in Cypress, leveraging fixtures, conditional structures, error handling, variable manipulation, mapping, loop structures, and logical operations. It provided a comprehensive demonstration of my skills in utilizing various aspects of Cypress to conduct thorough and effective testing.
